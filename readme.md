# HTMLdoc Minification Plugin for Wordpress

A Wordpress plugin to minify HTML, inline CSS, and inline Javascript. Combines 3 of my projects:

- HTMLdoc - A tokeniser based HTML document parser and minifier, written in PHP
- CSSdoc - A tokeniser based CSS document parser and minifier, written in PHP
- JSlite - A tokeniser based Javascript minifier designed for compressing inline scripts on the fly, written in PHP

## Description

This plugin provides an administration panel to configure the minification options, once activated, pages will be minified according to the configuration options selected.

You can also control whether the administration system is minified.
